            Her journey to the mystic world began at a young age. She was deeply attracted to and self-initiated
            herself into Palmistry, at the age of 15, initially regaling her schoolteachers and classmates, who
            would queue-up to experience her skills. Over the years, she embraced meditation, became a voracious
            reader, took professional training, and got hooked on to Astrology, as the twelve squares too
            fascinated
            her. Her turning point came was when she learnt Reiki. It was the impact of her early Reiki
            practice,
            that got her to believe that her life-path was meant to be healing people and in discovering the
            occult.
            Reiki had such a calming effect that she ended-up being a Reiki Grand Master!
