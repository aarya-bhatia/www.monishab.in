My association with her is long back when she had begun her journey into the spiritual world, and I was still a wanderer. She mentored me through Reiki and guided me and my family at different stages through her tarot readings and remedies. Every time the faith, trust and her guidance rooting from clear intuition, thorough knowledge and compassionate heart was truly beneficial. Years passed, and we stay connected, had a challenging situation at my family, where everything seemed to be falling apart, and I was losing hake and control bath.

Once again I banked on her, and this time once again with her sessions of hypnotherapy and past life regression therapies which were full of deep knowledge the subject. Compassionate heat and clear mind she helped me one by one, step by step. There were many things that were totally new to us but. It all happened before us. Surprising, scary and painful but it was all aver with her in depth sessions and healing modalities. Whether it was same blockage as a past life or some other hindrance as external forces she was able to manage it all with Gods blessings and angels by her side. I am truly and sincerely thankful to her and I do feel blessed to have her as my mentor, friend, guide, healer and therapist.

Thank you so much.
With much love and gratitude.</p>

The great thing about doing a reading with her is that she is patient, and encourages you to ask as many question as you like. I found that she also leaves one full of hope, a rare ability.

She was very accurate about her predictions about not just my past but also present circumstances. Of course time will tell about the future-facing predictions but she is a lady who inspires much confidence. So much so that I took my husband to her for a reading too!</p>

I would like to write a few lines, as I am especially thankful to Mrs. Monisha Bhatia because of her way of helping me and giving wonderful suggestions and remedies. I have now started getting results of my works. I was going through a difficult period in my life, I have met many obstacles and negative things in life. It blocked my success in life, such as in my career but she is helping me to work out smoothly. I was born with a different name but now I got changed with my new name which I really like. A very famous writer Shakespeare said “what is in a name?” but I must say there are lots of secrets in one’s name. It need to be corrected, though things didn’t change overnight but I strongly believe the energy of name of a person of course helps to bring the life in different good ways. Thank you so much for all the greatest helps that you’ve been provided to me. I’m really appreciated for your helps. Regards</p>

She charges a very nominal fee for consultations. She has been one of the most comprehensive readers I have been to. Her predictions are pretty much accurate and she would utilize all her knowledge in the fields of occult- tarot, numerology, astrology, dowsing, angel healing, reiki etc. to help you provide solutions to your most urgent and difficult situations. The remedies she suggested were very reasonable and effective. One of the very best occultist that I have met in the recent times. I wish her all the best in her endeavor. Thank you Monisha and thank you Justdial.</p>
